  "opening": {
    "reflection_p1": "Your aura unfolds like a map, Alexandra, revealing patterns shaped by choices, instincts, and devotion. This first glimpse offers what rises fastest: the themes guiding you now and the tone of the deeper insights waiting when you decide to unlock them.",
    "reflection_p2": "Think of this teaser as a mirror held to your aura: it shows the strongest colors while hinting at layers beneath. The full reading waits with richer context, but this moment already invites you to breathe, notice, and trust what you feel."
  },
  "life_foundations": {
    "paragraph_1": "Your life line holds steady depth with a gentle fork near the base, showing resilience built through deliberate choices. The curve toward your thumb signals vitality that returns whenever you rest intentionally. It anchors the rest of the reading because your body keeps following what you consciously practice. A faint sister line suggests mentors appear when you ask and routines form once you commit.",
    "paragraph_2": "The heart line rises cleanly, hinting at emotional depth that stays discerning. Subtle ridges near the center suggest you learned to offer warmth after trust is earned. The way it approaches the head line shows you balance intuition with thoughtful decisions when the stakes feel meaningful. The balanced slope hints you can soothe others without losing yourself when boundaries are named clearly.",
    "paragraph_3": "Faint vertical lines beneath your fingers speak to devotion and slow-burning ambition. They say you collect momentum one intentional promise at a time. When stress builds, your aura shows you recover by naming what matters and releasing the extra noise that does not belong to you.",
    "core_theme": "You grow strongest through steady, intentional choices that honor your pace and pair intuition with patience to keep you grounded."

  "love_patterns": {
    "preview_p1": "Your heart line curves toward your index finger, Alexandra, suggesting discernment matched with sincerity. You open slowly, then fully, preferring clarity over charm when choosing who sits closest to you. Your aura wants proof of reciprocity before you pour even more tenderness in.",
    "preview_p2": "Fine crosshatching beneath your ring finger hints at magnetic chemistry that feels fated yet familiar. You are learning to trust love that is calm, not just exciting, because steadiness is what lets you stay soft.",
    "locked_teaser": "Your love pattern + what to stop repeating sits just beyond this veil, waiting for your next yes.",
    "locked_full": "Your heart line shows you love without rushing. The balanced curve near Jupiter shows you read sincerity quickly and prefer to stay until a connection proves itself trustworthy. The gentle rise toward the index finger hints at loyalty that grows from small daily acts. At times you protected yourself by giving only what was asked, but the lighter etching on the upper heart line says you now offer more when you feel fully seen. Branches reaching toward the head line reveal a mind that negotiates emotions carefully, proof that intellect and tenderness sit side by side for you. The faint island near the start suggests a past pattern of over-giving; you learned to pause when reciprocity lagged. In the present, your aura invites you to name what you need aloud. You stop repeating cycles when you ask for shared effort early. When you do, your love life steadies into mutual devotion that feels both calming and thrilling."

  "career_success": {
    "main_paragraph": "Your fate line travels upward with a slight curve, pointing to success that grows when your work stays aligned with your values. You perform best when you own your decisions and design your pace. The clarity of your head line suggests you translate ideas into plans that quietly win respect. Slow build, steady delivery, and visible meaning create the conditions where you thrive.",
    "modal_love_patterns": "Your aura shows affection deepens when shared projects feel balanced. You are drawn to sincerity over spectacle, and partnerships flourish when responsibilities feel fair and openly discussed. Creating space for honest debriefs keeps resentment away.",
    "modal_career_direction": "The faint sun line signals creativity that wants to be seen, but only when the work stays meaningful. You thrive in roles where you can make choices and see the ripple of your efforts. Autonomy plus purpose will keep you motivated longer than pressure.",
    "modal_life_alignment": "Parallel lines near the wrist suggest balance arrives when you honor rest as much as ambition. Your aura wants you to protect rituals that refuel you so success feels sustainable. Recovery time is not wasted time; it is the fuel your future needs."

  "personality_traits": {

  "challenges_opportunities": {
    "preview_p1": "The faint breaks along your fate line hint at pauses when momentum dipped. Each pause asked you to reset expectations and choose a truer route instead of chasing urgency that wasn't yours.",
    "preview_p2": "Subtle stress lines near the heart line show where you carried other people's worries. They also reveal the opportunity: releasing what is not yours frees the energy needed for what is.",
    "locked_teaser": "What to release now + where your next opening hides when you embrace slower timing.",
    "locked_full": "Your aura shows a season where progress slows only to redirect you. The slight break in your fate line near the center points to a recent pause that invited reflection rather than defeat. You likely felt pressure to hurry, yet the line resumes with cleaner depth, suggesting you chose to realign instead of forcing the old path. Horizontal stress lines near the heart line note where you took on other people's anxiety; letting those obligations go is the first door to the next opportunity. The intuition line curving toward the moon mount signals your inner guidance is sharp right now. When you honor that pull, the head line clears and decision fatigue eases. The opportunity is hidden in slower steps: small pilot projects, quiet rehearsals, conversations with allies who already value your pace. Your aura says the opening arrives when you trust the pause as a waypoint, not a wall."

  "life_phase": {
    "preview_p1": "Your aura shows a transition chapter: the life line widens, hinting at fresh support entering soon. It feels like moving from crowded noise into a room with more air.",
    "preview_p2": "A faint upward branch points to something ending cleanly while a quieter habit begins. This phase invites you to let the new routine take root before announcing it loudly.",
    "locked_teaser": "Your current chapter + the first step into the next one, named in calm detail.",
    "locked_full": "A branch rising from the life line near the midpoint signals a chapter change. You are stepping out of an overextended season into a steadier rhythm. The overlap between life and head lines shows the mind catching up with the body; you are integrating what you learned instead of pushing ahead ungrounded. A subtle fork toward the thumb suggests community support is available if you ask. This is a phase of deliberate rebuilding: refining your calendar, choosing nourishing relationships, and setting gentle boundaries. Expect moments of doubt as the old pace fades; the aura shows a brief wobble before the new groove holds. Trust the small rituals you design now-morning clarity, evening closure-as they lock in the new phase. Within months, the widened life line indicates stamina returning, matched by clearer thinking and a calm sense of direction. A rising support line hints at travel or study that refreshes you midway through the shift."

  "timeline_6_months": {
    "preview_p1": "The next six months look like a gradual unfurling. January and February ask for patience while foundations strengthen quietly beneath the surface, reminding you that slow roots make steady branches.",
    "preview_p2": "By April a sharper rise in the fate line suggests a clear invitation: a project, role, or collaboration that feels aligned. Late spring wants you to say yes to the thing that already feels true.",
    "locked_teaser": "Month-by-month guidance + the choice that unlocks momentum and keeps energy balanced.",
    "locked_full": "Month 1-2: Your aura shows consolidation. The fate line's steadiness here says focus on routines, savings, and finishing loose ends. Avoid scattering your energy by agreeing to every ask. Month 3: A slight curve toward the sun mount suggests creative exposure - share a draft, a proposal, or a pilot. Month 4: The line deepens; opportunities meet preparation. Say yes to the aligned one, even if it feels stretching. Month 5: Parallel support lines hint at collaboration. Partner with someone who respects your pace and wants quality over speed. Month 6: The fate line clears, meaning momentum compounds. This is when you see the payoff of earlier discipline. Across all months, a fine intuition line reminds you to check decisions against what your body feels, not just what looks smart on paper. Small, steady steps keep the path open, and rest days protect the gains you build. Celebrate each checkpoint so your body knows progress is real."

  "guidance": {
    "preview_p1": "Notice where you rush to prove yourself. Your aura suggests the next shift comes from honoring deliberate pacing and naming your needs early. Protect the rituals that refill you so the work stays heartfelt, not hurried. Ask for aligned timelines, leave space between commitments, and let calm be proof of progress.",
    "locked_teaser": "Three focus points + the devotion that deserves your attention, described plainly.",
    "locked_full": "Your guidance centers on three focus points. First: Pace. The life line urges steadiness; build rest into your calendar the way you schedule meetings so your energy can refill. Second: Voice. The heart line's clean rise shows your words land when shared calmly. State your needs before resentment forms, and repeat them kindly until they are honored. Third: Craft. The sun line's faint glow wants you to practice in the open. Share work-in-progress with trusted allies to build confidence and momentum. Together these focus points create a daily devotion: protecting your body's signals, speaking with clarity, and letting your work be seen without waiting for perfection. When you honor them, your aura indicates pressure lines soften and energy returns in waves rather than spikes. Steadiness, not hurry, becomes your new proof of success. The more you trust this rhythm, the more your aura opens to ease. Let softness guide your timing and keep your pace kind."
